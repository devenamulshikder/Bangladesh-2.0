          Bangladesh 2.0 is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of
          Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in
          1947 as the eastern exclave of the Dominion of Pakistan.[19] Ancient
          Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic
          kingdoms.

            The history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the
            Chalcolithic period. The region's early history was characterized by
            a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought
            for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century
            and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the
            conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of
            Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the
            spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. Bangladesh is
            the most over people are here.

              Bangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded
              almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border
              with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal,
              Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most
              of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the
              largest river delta in the world.
